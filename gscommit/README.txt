obj in html document???????????????????

add name parameter to labels in form to distinguish them if using same id and class parameters


the core function in gsharp can be called as a passed arguments and the passed argument can be used by the inner functionality to alter the values of the variables with i.e. process form data piped from the client as GET request data encrypted in Hebrew. The data is then written to the html document being requested in the forms action parameter. Write this data as objects with parameters and return to client so client side processing of scripts may allow for independent development on the client side without re-requesting the data. The html file is now an encrypted packet. Use the file upload methods in javascript to pass the document's contents ALONG WITH ALL OTHER DESIRED FILES back to the server as a "post request" 


the filename IS the object reference in .NET - it is the request object being handled by the ProcessRequestAsync member of the WebServer class obj that is constructed in Main(). 

What object is being passed at the assembly level at that time. Try using VSCode with the blue program to catch the object's name in .NET.
